## Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaueMarques/kaueMarques/master/hi.gif" width="30px" height="30px">

I'm Erick Nathan 🚀 and I work as a Full-Stack Developer. I finished the Systems Development technical course and I'm improving my technical knowledge more and more, ready to be able to impact more and more lives and routines using programming!

### Currently my stack is:

📱 Mobile Apps with React Native (Hybrid Systems) and some knowledge to use Java and Kotlin natively

💻 Front-end web development with ReactJS and its derived libraries

📡 REST APIs using Node.js and its main libraries

💾 Storage in relational databases (SQL) like MySQL or non-relational using Firebase/MongoDB

### About me:

- 💻 I currently work at [Pagtel](https://pagtel.com.br) and am a freelancer in my spare time.

- 🎓 I finished a technical course in Systems Development at SENAI Jandira in June 2022.

- 💬 Ask me about anything, but know that we are in a continuous learning process ;)

- 🔭 I'm always open to discover new things.

- 💡 I try to help people who are starting in programming.
