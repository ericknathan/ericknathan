## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Erick Nathan ðŸš€ and I work as a front-end developer, improving my technical knowledge more and more, being prepared to be able to impact more and more lives and routines using programming!

### Currently my stack is:

ðŸ’» Front-end web development with ReactJS and Svelte together with their derived libraries like NextJS and SvelteKit respectively.

ðŸ“± Mobile Apps with React Native (Hybrid Systems) and some knowledge to use Java and Kotlin natively.

ðŸ“¡ REST APIs using Node.js and its main libraries.

ðŸ’¾ Storage in relational databases (SQL) like MySQL or non-relational using Firebase/MongoDB.

### About me:

- ðŸ’» I currently work at [Febrafar](https://febrafar.com.br).

- ðŸ“š I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development at FIAP - Faculty of Informatics and Administration Paulista from Brazil.

- ðŸŽ“ I am a technician trained in Systems Development by SENAI Jandira.

- ðŸ”­ I'm always open to discovering new things.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything, know that we are in a continuous learning process ;)

- ðŸ’¡ I try to help people who are starting programming.
